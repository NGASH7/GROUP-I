PYTHON EXPLANATION TO:
MANAGE.PY
1.	The shebang line #!/usr/bin/env python indicates that the script should be executed using the Python interpreter.
2.	The script imports necessary modules:
•	os: Provides a portable way to interact with the operating system.
•	sys: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter.
3.	The main() function is defined. This function is the entry point of the script.
4.	Inside the main() function:
•	It sets the default value for the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to 'e_voting.settings'. This indicates the settings module for the Django project.
•	It attempts to import the execute_from_command_line function from django.core.management. If Django is not installed or not available, it raises an ImportError with a helpful message.
•	Finally, it calls execute_from_command_line(sys.argv), which executes the command passed through the command line.
5.	The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the main() function is only executed if the script is run directly (not imported as a module).
In summary, this script is a standard Django management script used to run administrative tasks, such as managing database migrations, starting the development server, and executing custom management commands from the command line
